birdnet_run.py — BirdNET inference script for the Audacity or Sonic-Visualiser VAMP plugin.
 
This script is called by the VAMP plugin (BirdNetPlugin.cpp) as a subprocess.
It loads a BirdNET acoustic model, runs species prediction on a WAV file,
and prints the results as a JSON array to stdout.
 
Consecutive or overlapping detections of the same species are merged into a
single detection spanning from the first to the last segment, with confidence
computed as the average across all merged segments.
 
Usage:
    uv run birdnet_run.py <wav_path> [threshold] [top_k] [stride] [freq_min] [freq_max] [geo_model_confidence] [lat] [lon] [week]
 
Arguments:
    wav_path   : Path to the input WAV file.
    threshold  : Minimum confidence score to report a detection (default: 0.25).
    top_k      : Maximum number of species to consider per segment (default: 10).
    stride     : Sliding window step in seconds, in range [0.1, 3.0] (default: 3.0).
    freq_min   : Lower bound for the bandpass filter in Hz (default: 0).
    freq_max   : Upper bound for the bandpass filter in Hz (default: 15000).
    geo_model_confidence : Minimum confidence for geographic model filtering (default: 0.03). It only has effect if lat and lon parameters are set.
    lat        : Latitude for geographic filtering, 0.0 = disabled (default: 0.0).
    lon        : Longitude for geographic filtering, 0.0 = disabled (default: 0.0).
    week       : Week of the year for seasonal filtering, 0 = disabled (default: 0). It only has effect if lat and lon parameters are set.
 
Output:
    JSON array of detections, each containing:
        - species    : Common name of the detected species.
        - scientific : Scientific name of the detected species.
        - confidence : Average confidence score across merged segments (4 decimal places).
        - time_s     : Start time of the merged detection in seconds.
        - end_s      : End time of the merged detection in seconds.

    Merge consecutive or overlapping detections of the same species.
