A VAMP plugin for [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) and/or [Sonic-Visualiser](https://sonicvisualiser.org/) that runs [BirdNET v2.4](https://github.com/birdnet-team/birdnet) inference to automatically detect and label bird vocalizations in audio recordings.

Detections appear as labeled regions directly on the label track (Audacity) or as an annotation layer (Sonic-Visualiser), with the species name and confidence score. Consecutive or overlapping detections of the same species are automatically merged into a single label.

> ⚠️ **Important:** This repository includes a compiled fork of Audacity 3.7.7 with a VAMP plugin bug fix for proper multi-track support (bug fixed by me). To work correctly, run it with **Audacity-VampFix-3.7.7-x86_64.AppImage**.

### How it looks in Sonic-Visualiser

## Features

- Automatic bird species detection using BirdNET v2.4 (TensorFlow backend)
- Labels appear as a label track or annotation layer with species name and confidence score
- Nine configurable parameters via VAMP plugin interface:
  - **Confidence Threshold** — minimum confidence score to report a detection (default: 0.25)
  - **Top K Species** — maximum number of species candidates per segment (default: 10)
  - **Stride (s)** — sliding window step size in seconds (default: 3.0)
  - **High-pass cutoff frequency** — minimum frequency for bandpass filter in Hz (default: 0)
  - **Low-pass cutoff frequency** — maximum frequency for bandpass filter in Hz (default: 15000)
  - **Latitude** — latitude for geographic species filtering; 0.0 = disabled (default: 0.0)
  - **Longitude** — longitude for geographic species filtering; 0.0 = disabled (default: 0.0)
  - **Week of the Year** — week number (1–52) for seasonal filtering; 0 = disabled (default: 0)
  - **Geographic Model Confidence** — minimum confidence for the geographic model filter (default: 0.03)
- Works on full recordings or selected segments
- Consecutive and overlapping detections of the same species are merged automatically
- Optional geographic and seasonal filtering using BirdNET's built-in geo model

## Requirements

- Ubuntu 22.04 with internet connection 
- [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) installed at `~/miniconda3`
- `cmake`, `g++`, and `vamp-plugin-sdk` (installed automatically by `install.sh` script)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/juancolonna/birdnet-vamp.git
cd birdnet-vamp
```

> **Note:** This repository needs Git Large File Storage (LFS).

### 2. Run the installation script

```bash
./install.sh
```

The script will automatically:
- Install system build dependencies (`cmake`, `g++`, `vamp-plugin-sdk`)
- Create a Conda environment named `birdnet-plugin` with Python 3.12
- Install the `birdnet` Python package inside the Conda environment
- Compile the VAMP plugin into the `build/` directory
- Copy `birdnet_run.py` into `build/` alongside the plugin
- Creates the ~/vamp directory in your Linux HOME folder, then copies the files `birdnet_run.py` and `birdnet-vamp.so` into it.

> **Note:** The installation does not modify or remove any existing Audacity or Sonic-Visualiser installation on your system. The bundled AppImage runs independently.

### 3. Configuration and execution scripts

```bash
./audacity.sh
```
or
```bash
./sonic-visualiser.sh
```

- Verifies the integrity of the *.AppImage files via SHA256 checksum.
- Creates a desktop shortcut named **Audacity-BirdNet** or **Sonic-BirdNet** in your application menu

## Running

### From the application menu

After installation, open **Audacity-BirdNet** or **Sonic-BirdNet** from your application menu. The shortcut automatically sets `VAMP_PATH` to the correct directory.

### From the terminal

```bash
VAMP_PATH=$PWD/build ./Audacity-VampFix-3.7.7-x86_64.AppImage
```
or
```bash
VAMP_PATH=$PWD/build ./SonicVisualiser-5.2.1-x86_64.AppImage
```

> Run this command from inside the `birdnet-vamp` directory.

## Usage on Audacity

1. Open an audio file in Audacity-BirdNet (**File → Open**)
2. Optionally select a specific region of the track to analyze
3. Go to **Analyze → BirdNET**
4. Adjust parameters if desired
5. Click **OK** and wait for the analysis to complete
6. Detections appear as labeled regions on a new label track

> **Note:** Stereo audio files are automatically mixed down to mono by averaging both channels when you execute the BirdNet plugin, which may produce slightly different results compared to a native mono recording. If you are unsure, convert your audio to mono before running **Analyze → BirdNET**.

## Usage on Sonic-Visualiser

1. Open an audio file in Sonic-BirdNet (**File → Open**)
2. Optionally select a specific region of the track to analyze
3. Go to **Transform → Analysis by Plugin Name → BirdNET**
4. Adjust parameters if desired
5. Click **OK** and wait for the analysis to complete
6. Detections appear as labeled regions on a new label layer

## Annotation format

Each label on the track follows the format:

```
Species Name (XX%)
```

For example:
```
Black-capped Chickadee (82%)
House Finch (61%)
```

Where `XX%` is the average confidence score across all merged segments.

> **Tip:** The output labels can be exported in CSV format via **File → Export Other → Export Labels** in Audacity, or via **File → Export Annotation Layer** in Sonic Visualiser, for further analysis.

## How it works

1. When **BirdNET** is triggered, the VAMP plugin accumulates all audio samples into a buffer
2. At the end of the stream, it writes the buffer to a temporary WAV file
3. It invokes `birdnet_run.py` as a subprocess using the Python interpreter from the `birdnet-plugin` Conda environment
4. The Python script runs BirdNET v2.4 inference and returns detections as a JSON array via stdout
5. Consecutive or overlapping detections of the same species are merged into single labels
6. The plugin reads the JSON, creates VAMP features, and displays them as labeled regions in Audacity or Sonic-Visualiser
7. The temporary WAV file is deleted after processing

## Geographic and Seasonal Filtering

When Latitude 'and' Longitude are set to non-zero values, the plugin activates BirdNET's geographic model to filter the species list before running acoustic inference. This restricts detections to species that are realistically expected at the given location, significantly reducing false positives. Optionally, setting Week of the Year (1–52) further narrows the filter to species expected at that location during that season. For example, a migratory species present only in summer will be excluded outside its expected seasonal window.

The Geographic Model Confidence parameter controls how broadly the geo model selects candidate species. Lower values (e.g., 0.01) include more species in the filter; higher values (e.g., 0.1) apply a stricter regional filter.

> **Note:** Geographic filtering has no effect if any, Latitude or Longitude, are left at 0.0.

## Troubleshooting

**Plugin does not appear in Analyze menu**
- Make sure `VAMP_PATH` points to the `build/` directory
- Re-run `./install.sh` to recompile and reconfigure

**No detections produced**
- Try lowering the **Confidence Threshold** (e.g., 0.1)
- Make sure the audio contains bird vocalizations
- Check that the Conda environment is correctly installed: `conda activate birdnet-plugin && python3 -c "import birdnet; print('OK')"`

**Audacity shows "not responding" during analysis**
- This is expected — BirdNET inference with TensorFlow can take 10–30 seconds depending on audio length
- Click **Wait** and the analysis will complete normally
